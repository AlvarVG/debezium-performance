# Apache Kafka Service (Integrated in Compose)

This project integrates Apache Kafka into a working docker-compose.yml stack to enable high-throughput, distributed messaging and stream processing. It is commonly used for event-driven architectures, log aggregation, real-time analytics, and as a messaging backbone for microservices.

## Purpose

By including Kafka in the same docker-compose.yml as your supporting services (e.g., ZooKeeper, producers, and consumers), you gain:

* A scalable publish-subscribe messaging platform
* Reliable message delivery across distributed systems
* Native integration with stream processing tools and data pipelines
