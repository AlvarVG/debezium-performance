# OBSERVER MACHINE

In this folder you will find two different folders, the first one for creating a standar open sourced monitoring framework (grafana + prometheus); the second one creating all the load into the database. 

## Objetives

* **Centralized Monitoring and Visualization**: Establish a centralized platform for real-time monitoring and visualization of system and application metrics.
* **Proactive Performance Management**: Enable proactive detection of performance bottlenecks, system anomalies, and capacity issues.
* **Metric-Driven Observability**: Promote metric-based observability by collecting, storing, and querying high-dimensional data.
* **Benchmark Data Store Performance**: Evaluate the baseline performance of various databases, therefore, impacting in Debezium behavior.
* **Provide Insight for Optimization**: Identify potential performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities across the application stack.
* **Understand System Behavior Under Stress**: Simulate high-throughput and high-concurrency scenarios to observe system behavior under stress conditions and identify potential failure points or performance degradation.

## Architecture Overview

This section outlines the integrated architecture used for performance benchmarking and monitoring, combining YCSB for workload generation, Prometheus for metrics collection, and Grafana for visualization and alerting.
